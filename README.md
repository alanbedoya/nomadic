## Nomadic (still being developed)

This was built with some life experience in mind. As someone who use to be in a band and tour, we would have to either sleep in a van or by chance sleep on the floor of someone's apartment. That's where the idea for Nomadic came! Nomadic is similar to AirBnB but the main focus is for touring bands. A band can search up the area they're going to be at and see what places are posted up. This is a full-stack application built from a Rest API I created.
